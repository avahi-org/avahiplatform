```

## Configuration

### AWS Credentials Setup 🔐
AvahiPlatform requires AWS credentials to access AWS Bedrock and S3 services. You have two options for providing your AWS credentials:

Default AWS Credentials
- Configure your AWS credentials in the ~/.aws/credentials file
- Or use the AWS CLI to set up your credentials

Explicit AWS Credentials
- Pass the AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key directly when calling functions

💡 Tip: For detailed instructions on setting up AWS credentials, please refer to the [AWS CLI Configuration Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html).

Ensuring your AWS credentials are correctly set up will allow you to seamlessly use all of AvahiPlatform's powerful features. If you encounter any issues with authentication, double-check your credential configuration or reach out to our support team for assistance.
