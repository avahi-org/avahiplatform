ICD-10 Code Generation Process:

Patient Encounter:

Healthcare provider examines patient
Diagnoses condition or performs procedure


Documentation:

Provider records detailed clinical notes
Includes symptoms, diagnoses, procedures


Medical Coding:

Trained coder reviews documentation
Identifies relevant diagnoses and procedures


Code Selection:

Coder navigates ICD-10-CM (diagnosis) or ICD-10-PCS (procedure) manual
Locates appropriate category and subcategory


Code Specificity:

Selects most specific code based on documentation
Considers factors like laterality, severity, and etiology


Code Verification:

Checks for correct code structure (3-7 characters)
Ensures all necessary digits are included


Multiple Coding:

Assigns additional codes if multiple conditions present
Follows coding guidelines for primary and secondary diagnoses


Compliance Check:

Verifies adherence to coding rules and guidelines
Ensures code matches documentation


Quality Assurance:

Second coder or supervisor may review for accuracy
Automated systems may flag potential errors


Code Finalization:

Approved codes are entered into patient's medical record
Codes are used for billing, reporting, and data analysis


Continuous Education:

Coders stay updated on ICD-10 changes and updates
Regular training ensures accurate and compliant coding
